# mask-map

Mask Map (https://maskmap.us/) is a web app that allows users to track mask behavior as they make their way through their day. Users can log data by clicking the emoji that corresponds to the behavior that they have observed. The data will be mapped on the interface and aggregated with city-level data so everyone can get a better sense for what mask wearing is like around their city at a hyperlocal level. 

The project was initially developed during Hacktoberfest 2020, and the code and aggregated data will be open source.
