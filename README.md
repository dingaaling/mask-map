# mask-map

Mask Map (https://maskmap.us/) is a web app that allows users to track mask behavior as they make their way through their day. Users can log data by clicking the emoji that corresponds to the behavior that they have observed. The data will be mapped on the interface and aggregated with city-level data so everyone can get a better sense for what mask wearing is like around their city at a hyperlocal level. 

Note: in order to log data, users must grant access to Location Services on their device and sign in with a Gmail account for authentication. This data will not be stored. For more information on how to operate the app and data collection, please reference this article: https://jending.medium.com/mapping-mask-behavior-in-your-neighborhood-a5ab15380761.

The project was initially developed during Hacktoberfest 2020, and the code and aggregated data will be open source.
